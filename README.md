# About me
My Name is **Nick Plathe**, a student of biomathematics at the [University of Greifswald](https://www.uni-greifswald.de/). I'm mostly interested in data science and data analysis and explore these fields preferrably with R and Python, but am curious about other things, too.

*More here soon™*
