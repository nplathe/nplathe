# About me
My Name is **Nick Plathe**, I am currently affiliated with the [Leibniz Institute for Plasma Science and Technology](https://www.inp-greifswald.de), working as a part time assisstant besides my studies of biomathematics at the [University of Greifswald](https://www.uni-greifswald.de/). I'm mostly interested in data science and data analysis and explore these fields preferrably with R and Python, but am curious about other things, too.

*More here soon™*
